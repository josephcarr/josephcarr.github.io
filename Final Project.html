            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>My name is Joseph Carrasco. I am a First Year student at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science. 
            I graduated from Panther Creek High School in North Carolina. I play soccer but I am not really competitive and I also 
            have a hobby in boxing. I really enjoy playing video games, mostly fighting and racing games.</p>
            <p>I am the third and last child of my family. I have two older brothers and a dog. I recently moved from North Carolina
            to Newport, Rhode Island. I have been to many places in the US and my favorite season is fall.</p>
