        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Joseph Carrasco. I am a First Year student at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science.
        I play soccer but I am not really competitive and I also have a hobby in boxing. I highly enjoy playing video games,
        mostly fighting and racing games.</p>

        to Newport, Rhode Island. I have been to many places in the US and my favorite seaon is fall.</p>
